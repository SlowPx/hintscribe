## :warning: Important Notice About Application Trust
### Why You Might See a Security Warning
When you download and try to run Hintscribe, you might encounter a warning message from Windows stating that the app is not trusted. This is a standard message for many applications that aren't signed with a code signing certificate.

### Why There Isn't a Code Signing Certificate Yet
As of now, Hintscribe does not have a code signing certificate due to the associated costs. Code signing certificates, which help establish trust and assure users of the safety of an application, can be quite expensive, especially for individual developers or small teams.

### Our Commitment to Safety and Transparency
Although Hintscribe isn't open source, I assure you of my commitment to the safety and transparency of the application. Ensuring user security and maintaining a high standard of app integrity are top priorities in its development.

### Future Plans
I am exploring options to obtain a code signing certificate in the future to provide users with a smoother and more trusted installation experience. Your understanding and support are greatly appreciated.

### In the Meantime
If you encounter the warning, you can choose to proceed with the installation by clicking "More info" and then "Run anyway." This will allow you to install and use Hintscribe despite the absence of a code signing certificate.
